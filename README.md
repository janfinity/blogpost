# Write A Data Science Blog Post

Fuel prices in germany seem to have reached an all-time high. As part of my Data Science Nanodegree I wanted to further investigate on that.
Since August 31, 2013 companies that operate public fuel stations are obligated to inform the department for market transparency (MTS-K) about the pricing of their Super E5, Super E10 and Diesel fuels in real-time. This data was used for the investigation.

## Motivation

In the investigate-a-dataset jupyter notebook the following questions are beeing investigated:

- How did fuel prices develop since June 2014?
- Are there regional differences in the pricing of fuels?
- Have day of week or timer of day influence on the fuel prices?

## Conclusion

Fuel prices are subject to large fluctuations. However, the fluctuations are not cyclical, nor do they appear to follow any particular pattern. Since 06/2014 prices have not been higher than they are today.
It does not really make a huge difference on which day of the week you fuel up. By further taking hour of the day in consideration, we can see that it is best to fuel up between 18:00h and 22:00h. Taking in regard regional aspects, fueling up in the southern part of germany is more expensive than in the northern part.
